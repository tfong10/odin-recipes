            <ul>
                <li>5 chicken thighs</li>
                <li>1 tsp of salt</li>
                <li>1 tsp of pepper</li>
                <li>1 tsp of paprika</li>
                <li>1 tsp of dried parsley</li>
                <li>1 tbsp of olive oil</li>
                <li>1 tbsp of minced garlic</li>
                <li>1/2 cup of red onion</li>
                <li>1 cup of long grain rice</li>
                <li>1.5 cups of chicken broth</li>
                <li>salt to taste</li>
                <li>pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 400F</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, evenly season chicken thighs with salt, pepper, paprika, and parsley.</li>
                <li>On high, heat olive oil in a oven-proof pot and place chicken thighs, skin-side down, in the hot oil. Cook 5-6 minutes or the thighs develop brown crispy skin and flip over.</li>
                <li>Cook an additional 5-6 minutes to brown the other side and remove from the pot.</li>
                <li>Add the garlic and onions to the pot, and cook until the onions are transparent.</li>
                <li>Pour in the rice and chicken broth to the pot and season with salt and pepper. Stir well, bringing to a boil.</li>
                <li>Add the chicken thighs back into the pot, skin-side up, on top of the rice, bring back to a boil and cover with a lid.</li>
                <li>Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the rice is fully cooked.</li>
            </ol>
